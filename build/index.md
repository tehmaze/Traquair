## Print settings

The print settings for your slicer for all parts are recommended as follows:

|-|-|
| Filament          | ASA |
| Nozzle size       | 0.4mm |
| Layer height      | 0.2mm |
| Extrusion width   | 0.4mm (100%) |
| Permiters (walls) | 4 minimum |
| Top/bottom layers | 5 |
| Infill percentage | 40% |
| Infill type       | cubic, adaptive cubic or gyroid |
| Supports          | *not needed* |
| Brim              | *not needed* |

Should any of the parts require different print settings, you will find them
on the relevant [build pages](/build/).
